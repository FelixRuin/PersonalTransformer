Version: 0.1.8
  Features:
    - Added logic for Personal Transformers to work inside vehicles.
  Changes:
    - Changed changelog.txt to appropriate format.
  Current Bugs:
    - Vehicles do not drain energy properly. Vehicles can power the network but no drain from batteries currently occurs.
    - Transformers do NOT work if you put them in after other equipment. No idea why. 
    - Despite these bugs I've released this so that people could at least attempt to use the functionality. If you've got a fix, please let me know!
